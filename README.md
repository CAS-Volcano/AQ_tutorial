# Python code

This directory contains various bits of python code that can be used to analyse data:

- **AQ-code**: folder that contains a tutorial for Air Quality data.

The aim of this document is to help you to get started with the analysis of air quality data using python. You’ll need to install python and download the air quality datasets (or use the example dataset provided) to complete this tutorial. We provide you with an example ipython notebook that talks through some basic aspects of this type of data analysis, but please note that it is really just an example and not exhaustive. 

To download all the data and documents, click on the green ‘code’ button and download the zip file (and unzip it if this isn’t done automatically). When successful, this should give you a folder called python-code-master. Inside this folder you will find the AQ-code folder, which will contain all the files you need for this tutorial.
